## What is URDFHUB?

URDFHUB is a community-driven platform providing verified, simulation-ready **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)** models. We help roboticists spend less time fixing broken robot descriptions and more time building amazing things.

```
Browse → Clone → Simulate → Build
```

## Why URDFHUB?

- **Simulation-Ready** — Every model is tested with Gazebo, Isaac Sim, PyBullet, and MuJoCo
- **ROS 2 Compatible** — Native support for Humble, Iron, and Jazzy with launch files included
- **Community-Driven** — Built by roboticists, for roboticists
- **Well-Documented** — Joint limits, collision meshes, sensor configs, and detailed specs
- **Open Source** — MIT and Apache 2.0 licensed for research, education, and commercial use
